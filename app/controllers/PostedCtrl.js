// This is a controller for displaying the pins (pictures)
// inside the board (mimicing the homepage)


//you need to get the information from the boards on what pictures
//are actually in the board that is selected, and display only those
//pictures.  possibly a loop to do this combined with a way to read the
//json pulled from firebase.
